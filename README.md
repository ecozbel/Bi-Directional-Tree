# Bi-Directional Tree
 
A Bidirectional TreeMap is similar to Java's TreeMap class in that it stores associations between 
keys and values. The standard TreeMap enables looking up a value by the key in O(logn) time, while also enabling iteration over the keys in sorted order. In addition to searching by key in O(logn) time, a Bidirectional TreeMap also allows you to search by value in O(logn) time.
